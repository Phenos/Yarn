[![Codeship Status for Phenos/Yarn](=]https://codeship.com/projects/e6fa1bf0-691c-0133-c43d-666650db048e/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/114404)

## Plateform for interacive story-telling

Yarn is an online software patform for writing and playing interactive stories.

It is inspired by the text classics of text-based dungeons crawlers and later
generations of interactive story creation tools.

While being assisted by visual materials such as photo and wallpapers, the cord game mechanic
is all text based and is targetted at people who love reading, writting, intrigue and puzzles.

At the moment the platform is distributer on the web, but will eventually be deployed as
desktop and mobile apps on the various app stores.


## The Stories

Currently we are working on sample stories mostly as learning material and on a "first story"
to be released on the app-stores.

While it is an open-source project, at the moment the platform is still not "writer friendly".
But soon, we will also make it possible for anyone to write interactive stories and share them with
their fans with very little technical efforts.

## Technology

For the geeks...

The project is coded entirelly in javascript with tools like angular, node, bower, gulp, etc.

Yarn is based on a collection of technology:

- An HTML5 Web App game interface for playing the stories
- A specialised scripting language which is "non geek" friendly
- A parser, compiler and runtime for the yarn scripting language
- A data store specialised for semantic structures called a triple store

We deploy on multiple environments on the Heroku cloud platform.
