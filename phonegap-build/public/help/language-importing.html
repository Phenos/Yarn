    <h1>Importing</h1>

    <p>
        Most interactive stories will quickly grow up to thousands of lines of
        code. The more they grow the more unmanageable and confusing they can
        become.
    </p>
    <p>
        So it is a good idea to separate your stories into multiple files. When you
        start separating your story into multiple files, you need to tell which file
        should be "imported" where.
    </p>

    <h2>The "import" keyword</h2>

    <p>
        Here is an example with 3 files. A main file using the "<strong>import</strong>"
        keyword to import the other two.
    </p>
    <h4>story.txt</h4>
<code>
Story has Name "John's crummy bedroom".

import "characters.txt".
import "bedroom.txt".
</code>
    <h4>characters.txt</h4>
<code>
John is an Actor,
named "John Johnson",
is in the Bedroom.
</code>
    <h4>bedroom.txt</h4>
<code>
Bedroom is a Place,
called "The Bedroom".
</code>

    <h2>Importing Standard and Custom Libraries</h2>
    <p>
        The import feature is also crucial for importing in your story many of the standard
        game behaviors and mechanics. These standard libraries are provided by the Yarn team
        and are often the first thing you import in your story.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, if you have created parts of a story you would like reuse in another story, the import
        feature becomes crucial.
    </p>
    <p>
        These reusable part can be common locations, functionnal object (ex.: A camera that takes photos,
        a pencil that is empty after X uses, a usable set of coffee, coffee machine and coffee cups)
        or more fundamental game mechanics
        (ex.: Loosing blood & transfusion, Special Day Night cycles, etc).
