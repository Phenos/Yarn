    <h1>Punctuation</h1>

    <h2>Commas, periods and semi-colons.</h2>

    <p>
        By adding puncutation, you can create series of assertions that are both
        easier to write and easier to read.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example of how you can simplify longer texts by using commas.
    </p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog is a Dog.
Peter The Dog is in the Kennel.
Peter The Dog is Tired.
    </code>
    <p>
        Can be shortened to:
    </p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog is a Dog, is in the Kennel, is Tired.
    </code>
    <p>
        Just like a normal english sentence, the commas allow you to chain more assertions
        without having to repeat the subject.</p>

    <h2>Adding linefeeds</h2>
    <p>
        To keep your text more readable, you can cut you line of text inbetween the 3 parts
        of the assertions without any side-effects
    </p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog
is a Dog,
is in the Kennel,
is Tired
    </code>

    <h2>Indentation</h2>

    <p>
        You can also use indentation (additionnal spaces) if you want to
        give more structure to your code. This is purely aesthetics and will not change
        the behavior of the code.
    </p>
    <p>Let's add some to <em>Peter The Dog</em>:</p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog
  is a Dog,
  is in the Kennel,
  is Tired
    </code>

    <h2>Using quotes for texts and labels</h2>
    <p>For labels and long texts you simply use either the single or double quotes. Like this:</p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog
  is a Dog,
  has a Name "Peter T. Dog",
  is in the Kennel,
  has a Description
    'Peter your dog has had a long day.
    He looks very tired'
    </code>
    <p>
        Notice how you can also add line breaks to break long texts.
    </p>
    <h3>Quotes inside quotes</h3>
    <p>
        If you need to use quotes in your text, you have to be careful not to use the same
        type of quotes you used to start the text block. For example, these examples are valid:
    </p>
    <code>
Dog has a Description "This is a 'great' dog!".
Dog has a Description 'This is a "great" dog!'.
    </code>
    <p>
        But these examples will break your text:
    </p>
    <code>
Dog has a Description "This is a "great" dog!".
Dog has a Description 'This is a 'great' dog!'.
    </code>
    <p>
        Also, you can use the html "&amp;quot;" symbol for using double quotes inside double quotes.
        So this example is valid:
    </p>
    <code>
Dog has a Description "This is a &amp;quot;great&amp;quot; dog!".
Dog has a Description 'This is a &amp;quot;great&amp;quot; dog!'.
    </code>
    <h2>Add periods to prevent chaining.</h2>
    <p>
        Whenever you have assertions which precede or follow each others, you can
        make sure they dont automatically chain by adding a period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we make sure <em>John</em> and <em>PeterTheDog</em> dont get mixed up:
    </p>
    <code>
John loves Peter The Dog.
Peter The Dog
  is a Dog,
  has a Name "Peter T. Dog".
    </code>
    <p>
        Alternativelly, you can use two line breaks instead of periods. Like so:
    </p>
    <code>
John loves Peter The Dog

Peter The Dog is a Dog, has a Name "Peter T. Dog"

Silly Susan loves John
    </code>
