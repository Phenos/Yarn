    <h1>Templating</h1>

    <p>
        Whenever you use text in your source code, this text can contain special
        instructions to make this text dynamic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Templating is usefull for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vary text blocks according to conditions</li>
        <li>Insert values in text such as names, numbers, time and other values.</li>
        <li>Outputing dynamic lists of items.</li>
        <li>Doing maths with values in the game state.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Also, whenever a resulting text can be converted into a non-text value such as
        a number or a true/false value, the conversion will happen automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an example of a description that varies according to the player's
        current location.
    </p>
<code>
Magic Hat has a Description
"Your trusty pointy hat.
{% if value('Player is in the Castle') %}
    Too large and flappy as usual.
{% else %}
    Weirdly it is glowing octarine... you must
    be near the magic shop!.
{% endif %}"

</code>
    <p>
        Now, here an example where a character uses the players hair color in a sentence.
    </p>
<code>
Jenny says Dialog
"Wow you changed you hair! This {{ value('Player has Hair Color') }} suits you very well."
</code>
    <h3>Under the hood</h3>
    <p>
        This templating language is a fairly complexe piece of technology. It is both very powerful
        but can require a longer learning cureve than the rest of the YarnScript language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yarn is not the only product using this type of templating. It is called "Nunjucks" and is
        a distinct Mozilla open source project.
    </p>
    <p>
        A more extensive and generic purpose documentation is available on their website at:<br/>
        <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html">http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        As Yarn grows in capacity, we will provide more easy-to-reuse examples of templating. Until
        then you can pay attention whenever you see the "&#123; &#123; something } }" and "&#123% %}" curly brackets
        somewhere in Yarn's sample files.
    </p>
    <h2>Using the Inspector</h2>
    <p>
        Whenever you see a template in a story, you can check what would be the current "rendered"
        value by opening the inspector. It will render the value as you type and show you any error
        in the template.
    </p>
