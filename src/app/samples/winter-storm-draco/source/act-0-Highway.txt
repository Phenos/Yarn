        It is probably north of you[end if]."

/*
// todo: The comment changed depending if the hotdogs have been examined
Instead of going north in Highway, say
    "It's too late to go back to the store.
    [if the package of hot dogs is exed]
    You'll have to go home without buns
    [otherwise]
    Whatever you forgot, you can live without
    [end if]."

Instead of going south in Highway:
    say "Now you are walking into the woods.

        Now you are losing your bearings.

        You turn around, to retrace your path and return to the
        highway—but the snow has already covered your footsteps, and the trail
        (if it was indeed the trail) is invisible.

        Now you have no idea where you are."

    // Todo: move the user ?
    // wander around;
    // Todo: When starting to wander around, change the visibility
    // now visibility-text is "Pretty Bad".
