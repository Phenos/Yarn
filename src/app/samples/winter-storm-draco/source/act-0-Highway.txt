Book 1 - Highway

    Highway is a room.
        "[one of]That was the hard part. From here on it's a straight shot, no problem.
        [or][stopping]The grocery store is north, across the highway; that's where you just were.
        To the south is a trail through the woods, and on the other side of that is your house[one of].
        [paragraph break]You should try to get there quick, before the storm catches up with you[or][stopping]."

    The invisible house is scenery in highway.
    Instead of doing something with the invisible house, say
        "You can't see your house from here. It's on the other side of the woods."

    The road is scenery in highway.
    the description of the road is
        "The cars are all inching along carefully, and the snow on most of the road is undisturbed."

    Instead of searching the road, say
        "The people in the cars are difficult to see, shrouded by clouds of their own breath."

    The traffic signal is scenery in highway.
    The description of the traffic signal is
        "Green, amber, red, green. You should get a move on."

    The grocery store is scenery in highway.
    The description of the grocery store is
        "The grocery store is nearly abandoned; sensible people are all safe in their homes right now.
         But it is open, and its bright white lights shine out from its plate glass windows as a
         welcoming beacon to everyone who needs to stock up on bottled water before the blizzard hits."

    The streetlamps are plural-named scenery in highway.
    The description of the streetlamps is
        "Rows of streetlamps hang above the road in both directions, neither of
        which is the direction of your house."

    The trailhead is scenery in highway.
    The description of the trailhead is
        "As snow falls through the trees and blankets the forest, the trail gets more difficult to discern."

    The treeline is a backdrop.
    The treeline is in highway and nearwoods and nearshed.
    The description of the treeline is
        "[if location is highway]From here, the forest seems to go on forever—but it's really
        not that far to the other side[otherwise]It's getting harder to tell where the forest is.
        It is probably north of you[end if]."

    Instead of climbing the treeline, say "That is not part of your skillset."

    Instead of going north in Highway, say
        "It's too late to go back to the store. [if the package of hot dogs is exed]You'll have to go home
        without buns[otherwise]Whatever you forgot, you can live without[end if]."

    Instead of going nowhere in Highway, say
        "The way through the woods is south."

    Instead of going south in Highway:
        say "Now you are walking into the woods.[paragraph break]Now you are losing your
            bearings.[paragraph break]You turn around, to retrace your path and return to the
            highway—but the snow has already covered your footsteps, and the trail
            (if it was indeed the trail) is invisible.[paragraph break]Now you have no idea
            where you are.[paragraph break]";
        wander around;
        now visibility-text is "Pretty Bad".
