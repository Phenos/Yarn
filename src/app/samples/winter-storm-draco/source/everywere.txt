### The Snow

    The snow is a backdrop.
    The snow is everywhere.

    // todo: allow "trying" to pick-up snow
    Instead of taking the snow, say
        "You pick some snow up from the ground. It bites your fingers, and you drop it
        before it can finish melting in your grasp. You should have worn gloves."

    // todo: allow "trying" to eat snow
    Instead of eating the snow, say
        "You lift a handful of snow to your lips. Biting into it produces a hollow crunch,
        and it melts immediately in your mouth. It's all very much like eating unflavored shaved ice."

    The description of the snow is
        "Each flake falls at more or less the same rate, at the same gentle angle toward
        the ground, and the effect is as if this lattice of white motes were being projected
        onto the air by a disco ball. The snow on the ground is a completely different substance:
        An opaque layer of dust, thickening by the second."


### The Sky


    The sky is a backdrop.
    The sky is everywhere.

    //todo:
    The description of the sky is
        "The sky is a very low-hanging mass of clouds, tinged orange-pink by
        [if the location is Highway][otherwise]distant [end if]streetlamps."

    Instead of doing something other than examining with the sky, say
        "The sky is very far away."

### MyBreath

    The breath is a backdrop.
    The breath is everywhere.

    The description of the breath is
        "As you exhale, a cloud of mist rises and obscures your vision even further.
        It dissipates quicklyâ€”until you exhale again."
