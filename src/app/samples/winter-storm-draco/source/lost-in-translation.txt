## Act 1 : Highway

Instead of climbing the treeline, say "That is not part of your skillset."

## Road

Instead of searching the road, say
    "The people in the cars are difficult to see, shrouded by clouds of their own breath."

Instead of going nowhere in Highway, say
    "The way through the woods is south."
