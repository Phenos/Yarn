//todo: The player description is dynamic according to what he is wearing
The description of the player is
    "You are wearing [a list of things worn by the player]."

//todo: Should "wear" be a special type of predicate and mechanics ?
The player wears the puffy black jacket.

The description of the puffy black jacket is
    "This jacket is not flattering in the slightest, but it isn't supposed to
     look good: It is supposed to keep you from freezing to death. It's not
     doing a very good job of that, either."

//todo: Prevent the player from removing the jacket
Instead of taking off the puffy black jacket, say
    "As lousy as this jacket is, it's far better than
    the alternative. You'll keep it on."
