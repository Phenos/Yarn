    When play begins:

        In December of 2012, a weather system of colossal size brought itself into
        existence off the western coast of North America. As it passed over the mighty
        Rocky Mountains, the weather system increased in its intensity and destructive
        capability, its barometric pressure eventually falling to an astounding nine
        hundred and seventy-one millibars.

        Hundreds of feet of snow fell on the people of the Midwest. Thousands of those
        people were left without electricity, made to shiver by candlelight as they
        awaited the cataclysmic termination of the Mayan calendar. In Earth's Northern
        Hemisphere, the nights of the 19th and 20th were among the longest of the year,
        and in the American Midwest, they were also among the coldest, and the most
        fraught with dread.

        The Weather Channel gave a name to this weather system. The National Weather
        Service, having opposed The Weather Channel's practice of naming winter storms
        since its announcement in October of the same year, did not use or acknowledge
        this name. In the official records, the storm will be memorialized only by cold
        statistics, by two hyphen-separated dates.

        But language belongs to all of us, to each of us, and we invent our language anew
        each time we speak it. When you type a word into a computer, you decide with absolute
        authority what that word means to you, and your decision cannot be contested by any
        individual, social group, government entity, corporation, or text parser. If you
        choose to call a storm by a name, then that name is, if nowhere else but in your
        heart, the name of that storm. The name of the storm to which I refer is also the
        name of this text adventure computer game.

            You lope across the road with absurd syncopated steps, your arms unevenly
            heavy with grocery bags, your lumbering gait spotlit by six lanes of headlights.
            With each step you run the risk of falling over and making an even bigger fool
            of yourself.[paragraph break]Just as you reach the far side, the signal changes,
            and traffic resumes—slowly. Nobody's eager to start fishtailing
            across the fresh snow.[or][stopping]";
