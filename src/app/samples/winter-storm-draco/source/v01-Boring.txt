	Hi! Thank you for checking out my interactive documentary about Winter Storm Draco!

	This interactive documentary was supported by my many fabulous Patreon supporters, and I list them to you
	here in the order in which Patreon sees fit to list them to me: Thomas BÃ¸vith, Janice Eisen, Jeff Lindsay,
	Stuart Lloyd, Jason Baldus, Maiko Nathalie, Jacques Frechet, Zachary Hodgens, David Simon, Emily Short,
	Doug Orleans, Steven McKinney, Jason McIntosh, Matthew Zimmermann, Derek Sotak, Carl Muckenhoupt, Alan DeNiro,
	Rich Cheng, Hamish McIntyre, Jenni Polodna, Juhana Leinonen. At least one person is not in Patreon's list.
	There are an odd number in this list and there are an even number of supporters. Something screwy is going on.

	Jenni Polodna, and Emily Short, plus one post-release bug was discovered independently by Hanon Ondricek
	and Carter Sande.[paragraph break]Some elements of this interactive documentary were furnished by/stolen
