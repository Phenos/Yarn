//Todo: Figure out a way to do an introduction...
    
    When play begins:

        In December of 2012, a weather system of colossal size brought itself into
        existence off the western coast of North America. As it passed over the mighty
        Rocky Mountains, the weather system increased in its intensity and destructive
        capability, its barometric pressure eventually falling to an astounding nine
        hundred and seventy-one millibars.

        Hundreds of feet of snow fell on the people of the Midwest. Thousands of those
        people were left without electricity, made to shiver by candlelight as they
        awaited the cataclysmic termination of the Mayan calendar. In Earth's Northern
        Hemisphere, the nights of the 19th and 20th were among the longest of the year,
        and in the American Midwest, they were also among the coldest, and the most
        fraught with dread.

        The Weather Channel gave a name to this weather system. The National Weather
        Service, having opposed The Weather Channel's practice of naming winter storms
        since its announcement in October of the same year, did not use or acknowledge
        this name. In the official records, the storm will be memorialized only by cold
        statistics, by two hyphen-separated dates.

        But language belongs to all of us, to each of us, and we invent our language anew
        each time we speak it. When you type a word into a computer, you decide with absolute
        authority what that word means to you, and your decision cannot be contested by any
        individual, social group, government entity, corporation, or text parser. If you
        choose to call a storm by a name, then that name is, if nowhere else but in your
        heart, the name of that storm. The name of the storm to which I refer is also the
        name of this text adventure computer game.

    
    After printing the banner text:
        say "[one of][firststatus][line break]
            You lope across the road with absurd syncopated steps, your arms unevenly
            heavy with grocery bags, your lumbering gait spotlit by six lanes of headlights.
            With each step you run the risk of falling over and making an even bigger fool
            of yourself.[paragraph break]Just as you reach the far side, the signal changes,
            and traffic resumes—slowly. Nobody's eager to start fishtailing
            across the fresh snow.[or][stopping]";
    


    //Todo: Start with "low" visibility

    /*
    todo: Snow, breath and sky are everywhere... so how can I allow their examination without
    overwhelming the UI ? A way to put less important lookables in low priority when listing items ?
    Or could they be accessible only via clickable words in the text instead of buttons ?
    */

### The Snow

    The snow is a backdrop.
    The snow is everywhere.

    // todo: allow "trying" to pick-up snow
    Instead of taking the snow, say
        "You pick some snow up from the ground. It bites your fingers, and you drop it
        before it can finish melting in your grasp. You should have worn gloves."

    // todo: allow "trying" to eat snow
    Instead of eating the snow, say
        "You lift a handful of snow to your lips. Biting into it produces a hollow crunch,
        and it melts immediately in your mouth. It's all very much like eating unflavored shaved ice."

    The description of the snow is
        "Each flake falls at more or less the same rate, at the same gentle angle toward
        the ground, and the effect is as if this lattice of white motes were being projected
        onto the air by a disco ball. The snow on the ground is a completely different substance:
        An opaque layer of dust, thickening by the second."


### The Sky


    The sky is a backdrop.
    The sky is everywhere.

    //todo:
    The description of the sky is
        "The sky is a very low-hanging mass of clouds, tinged orange-pink by
        [if the location is Highway][otherwise]distant [end if]streetlamps."

    Instead of doing something other than examining with the sky, say
        "The sky is very far away."

### MyBreath

    The breath is a backdrop.
    The breath is everywhere.

    The description of the breath is
        "As you exhale, a cloud of mist rises and obscures your vision even further.
        It dissipates quickly—until you exhale again."



### The Player

        //todo: The player description is dynamic according to what he is wearing
        The description of the player is
            "You are wearing [a list of things worn by the player]."

        //todo: Should "wear" be a special type of predicate and mechanics ?
        The player wears the puffy black jacket.

        The description of the puffy black jacket is
            "This jacket is not flattering in the slightest, but it isn't supposed to
             look good: It is supposed to keep you from freezing to death. It's not
             doing a very good job of that, either."

        //todo: Prevent the player from removing the jacket
        Instead of taking off the puffy black jacket, say
            "As lousy as this jacket is, it's far better than
            the alternative. You'll keep it on."



Part 1 - Important Items

    //todo: Flag things as important to make them impossible to drop
    A thing can be important.

    //todo: If a thing is important, output a custom message
    Instead of dropping something important:
        say "Your housemates are expecting you to bring that home."

    //todo: Special case to allow puting important items only in the plastic bag
    Check inserting something important into something:
        if the second noun is the plastic bag or the second noun is the canvas bag:
            continue the action;
        otherwise:
            say "Your housemates are expecting you to bring that home. You can't leave it with [the second noun]." instead.

    // Todo: The "cant put this there" message should be customizable to include the objects name
    Check putting something important on something:
        say "Your housemates are expecting you to bring that home. You can't leave it on [the second noun]." instead.



### The Plastic Bag

    // todo: Should there be a "carries" predicate to mimic this syntax ? (which could convert to "is in")

            but you and your housemates probably cannot survive the whole storm on twelve hot
            dogs[one of].[paragraph break]It occurs to you that you forgot the buns[or][stopping]."

        Instead of opening the hot dogs, say
            "It's plenty cold out here, but it'd be more sanitary to leave the package sealed until
            you could put it in a proper refrigerator."

        Instead of eating the hot dogs, say
            "You should save those for when you're starving to death."

             it[otherwise]It's pretty well closed already[end if]."

        Instead of inserting something into the solo cups, say

                say "You take a leisurely sip, and it warms your insides—a little.";
            otherwise:
                say "That cup is empty."


        Before inserting the snow into the Solo cup: say
            "A cup of snow won't do you much good. A cup of water might be more useful,

            say "You apply the corkscrew with some difficulty, given how cold your hands are and

                have a loose cork and an open bottle on your hands.";
        otherwise:

    // todo: what is this supposed to do ?
    /*
    Before inserting a bottle (called boite) into the package of solo cups:
