    To decide whether collecting names:
        if the command prompt is "Please enter your full name. >", yes;
        no.

    The player's forename is a text that varies. The player's full name is a text that varies.

    After reading a command when collecting names:
        if the number of words in the player's command is greater than 5:
            say "[paragraph break]He sighs. 'Who are you, a member of the British royal family? No one has that many names. Let's try this again.'";

        now the player's full name is the player's command;
        now the player's forename is word number 1 in the player's command;

        say "[line break][fixed letter spacing]'Nice to meet you, [player's forename in title case]. So the tombstone will read: ['][Player's full name in title case], died December 20, 2012,['] and then in smaller text it'll say [']A Huge Idiot Who Was Too Cool To Wear Gloves.['] That's assuming anybody cares that much about your pathetic frozen corpse. Maybe they'll just let the birds take care of you.'[variable letter spacing] He looks up at the sky. [fixed letter spacing]'No, they've all flown south for the winter!'[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]You hear a [fixed letter spacing]'TEKELI-LI!'[variable letter spacing] from far off, and he grins.[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing]'Well, I'm here for the duration, so I'll try to comfort you in your final moments.

        reject the player's command.

Chapter 4 - Draco Resists Being Named

    Instead of naming draco with something:
        if draco is faraway:
            say "He's too far away to be named.";
        otherwise:
            now draco is passive;
            say "He squints at you. [fixed letter spacing]'I already have a name,'[variable letter spacing] he mutters."


Chapter 5 - Talking to Draco


Section 1 - Screaming

    Instead of screaming while draco is visible and draco is not faraway:
        say "You scream. He doesn't seem to notice."

Section 2 - Stupid Rule

    After reading a command when Draco is visible:
        if player's command includes " him", replace the matched text with " figure".

Section 3 - Conversation

    Instead of asking Draco about a topic listed in the Table of Draco Topics:
        now draco is passive;
        say "[reply entry][paragraph break]"

    Instead of asking Draco about something:
        say "He waves the notion away. [fixed letter spacing]'[one of]Next topic[or]Such things are beneath me[or]Boring[then at random].'[variable letter spacing][line break]"

    Instead of telling Draco about something:
        try asking the noun about it.

    Instead of answering Draco that something, say
        "He glares down at the source of your failing voice, and then he pointedly breaks eye contact. [fixed letter spacing]'I'm sorry,'[variable letter spacing] he says, [fixed letter spacing]'was there something you wanted to ask me about?'[variable letter spacing][line break]"

    Instead of answering Draco that "[draco]", try asking the noun about "[draco]".

    "[figure]"	"[one of]His nostrils flare, and fangs appear behind his twisted lips. [fixed letter spacing]'Do you not know who I am? Are you really so stupid?'[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]But he calms himself. [fixed letter spacing]'Of course you are. My mistake. All the same, maybe we should pursue a different topic of conversation--Until you're able to refer to me with a modicum of respect.'[variable letter spacing][or][fixed letter spacing]'Please,'[variable letter spacing] he says, raising a hand in warning, [fixed letter spacing]'We can't begin to talk about me. You have no idea what I am. You don't even know my name.'[variable letter spacing][stopping]"
    "[crows]"	"He halfheartedly stifles a chuckle.[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing]'My opinion is that you ought to treat crows with greater respect. I suppose I should say [']you ought to have treated.['] Your lack of civility hardly matters now, though, tense and aspect notwithstanding.'[variable letter spacing]"
    "[player]"	"[fixed letter spacing]'You? Your name is [player's full name in title case]; you decided (for whatever reason) against taking a bus or a taxi home from the grocery store; you cobbled together an exceedingly primitive compass. Then there was some brutish behavior in a cemetery, which wasted valuable energy that would have been better saved for use here, as you slowly succumb to hypothermia.'[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]He shrugs. [fixed letter spacing]'The rest of the story isn't really about you, per se. You and your dead body are equally unlucky but distinct entities.'[variable letter spacing]"
    "[jacket]"	"[fixed letter spacing]'I was wondering about that myself.'[variable letter spacing] He looks you over. [fixed letter spacing]'I was wondering whether you really thought you'd be warm enough in just that jacket, with no gloves, no hat, no long underwear, or whether perhaps you wore it as a display of flagrant disrespect. Which is it? Impudence or idiocy?'[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]Before you can answer, he hisses: [fixed letter spacing]'Both.'[variable letter spacing]"
    "[wine]"	"[fixed letter spacing]'Oh, please. I have no patience for your little corporeal entertainments. I know humans used to pour wine out onto any old thing, in an attempt to appease the gods. Which you did, a little ways back there, right? But guess what? I am not appeased.'[variable letter spacing]"
    "[hot dogs]"	"[fixed letter spacing]'I did notice your highly sophisticated taste, but I'm afraid food isn't an interest of mine. Eating is more of a human thing.'[variable letter spacing]"

    "wind"	"[fixed letter spacing]'What wind?'[variable letter spacing] He smirks until you're about to speak again, and then he interrupts you. [fixed letter spacing]'I don't think much about it, is the thing. I just go where it takes me.'[variable letter spacing]"
    "blizzard"	"[fixed letter spacing]He inhales through his fangs, exasperated. [fixed letter spacing]'Yes, a blizzard. A big, bad blizzard. A blizzard with a name.'[variable letter spacing]"

    "tekeli-li"	"[fixed letter spacing]'No. You're saying it wrong.'[variable letter spacing] He curves his serpentine neck and whistles: [fixed letter spacing]'TEKELI-LI! Like that. If you can't say it right, I'm not gonna tell you what it means.'[variable letter spacing]"

    "[cemetery]"	"[fixed letter spacing]'Yes, I recall watching you stumble through the cemetery. I saw you nearly trip over about a hundred tombstones.

    "[name]"	"He drums his fingers for a bit before he speaks. [fixed letter spacing]'I know you humans give each other names like candy canes at Christmas, but for a guy like me to have a name is kind of a big deal.

And everyone else--everyone who matters--they know me, and they'll remember me. You should be so lucky.'[variable letter spacing]"
    "[draco]"	"He bows deeply, approximating a demure expression. [fixed letter spacing]'Yes, that's me.

[fixed letter spacing]'I brought myself into existence off the western coast of North America a few days ago. I crossed the Rockies without difficulty and, having accumulated a profound amount of atmospheric moisture, I started to cover the middle of your continent with rain, snow, thunder and lightning, everything.

They'll appreciate me over there. For you Middle America yokels, every snowstorm's the same. A mild inconvenience! [']Uh-oh, we have to shovel the sidewalk again!['] But they'll really get me. They'll be talking about me for years: [']Winter Storm Draco.['][paragraph break]'Are you dead yet?'[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]No, you're thinking. If west is [italic type]that[roman type] way...[orient player]"

    Oriented is a truth state that varies. Oriented is false. [Refers specifically to loss of orientation in Whiteness.]

    To say orient player:
        now draco is proper-named;
        now printed name of draco is "Winter Storm Draco";
        now oriented is true.


    Before going south in whiteness:
        if oriented is true:
            say "You turn away from Winter Storm Draco and begin walking south.[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing]'Hey! Where are you going?'[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]A scrap of color flickers in the air ahead. Your eyes are playing tricks on you.[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing]'Hey, idiot! Get back here! You--'[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]His voice cracks, replaced by screeching and flapping so loud as to drown out even the wind. You break into a run.";
            now visibility-text is "Complicated";
            now description of snow is "The snow has stopped falling. It rests in a solid, perfectly level mass on top of every available surface.";
            now description of sky is "The sky, still a uniform mass of cloud, is now an odd pink color. The significance of this is unclear.";
            now player is in Euclid Street instead.

    Instead of going nowhere in whiteness while oriented is true:
        say "You cast an eye that way, hoping that some landmark will appear from out of the snow and confirm your sense of place, but nothing materializes. If you do know north from south, though, there's only one way to go."


Book 3 - Euclid Street

Section 1 - Description

    Euclid Street is a room. "[one of]As you run, you refamiliarize yourself with concepts of line, form, and color. Those shapes that appear to be smaller than the other shapes only seem that way because they're further from you. The thing that is furthest away is a 'vanishing point'—You can figure that out later. The orange-pink cast over all of the shapes is an effect of the streetlights, or perhaps the dawn. The shapes themselves are houses. Each of them is surrounded and covered by at least a foot of snow, a colorless substance with many interesting properties[or]You are on Euclid Street, the street where your house is[stopping].[paragraph break]Your house is south from here. To the north is something you are afraid to look at."

Section 2 - Scenery

    Some houses are plural-named scenery in euclid street. Understand "shape" and "shapes" and "yard" and "yards" and "doors" and "windows" and "porches" and "window" and "porch" as the houses. The description of the houses is "Houses are shapes with yards, doors, windows, porches, that sort of thing."

    Instead of entering the houses, try going south.

    The vanishing point is scenery in euclid street. The description of the vanishing point is "As you contemplate the implications of the process of vision and its relationship to real space, your head starts to hurt."

    The streetlights are plural-named scenery in euclid street. Understand "streetlight" and "streetlamps" and "streetlamp" as the streetlamps. The description of the streetlights is "You can see the effect of the streetlights on every surface they illuminate, but you can't see the lights themselves—Oh! They're up there."

    The dawn is plural-named scenery in euclid street. Understand "sun" as the dawn. Instead of examining the dawn, try examining the sky.

    The lane is scenery in euclid street. Understand "road" and "street" and "euclid street" and "line" as the lane. The printed name of the lane is "Euclid Street". The description of the lane is "Euclid Street is a line which separates one half of space from the other half. You are a point on this line. (This is a simplification, of course.)"

    A million screaming white crows are plural-named scenery in euclid street. Understand "storm" and "figure" and "winter storm draco" and "draco" and "crow" and "bird" and "birds" as the million screaming white crows. The description of the white crows is "[one of]You glance back at a million screaming white crows. They look to be catching up with you pretty fast[or]You may want to get inside before they get here[stopping]."

    Instead of examining north in euclid street, try examining the white crows.

    Instead of listening to something in Euclid Street, say "All you can hear is that [fixed letter spacing]'TEKELI-LI!'[variable letter spacing] over and over again, getting louder and closer all the time."

    Instead of listening to Euclid Street, say "All you can hear is that [fixed letter spacing]'TEKELI-LI!'[variable letter spacing] over and over again, getting louder and closer all the time."

    The real house is scenery in euclid street.
    The description of the real house is
        "Although covered in snow, it strongly resembles your own house. You have vivid memories of
        living in something almost identical to this. Yes. This is probably your house."

    Instead of opening the real house,
        try going south.

    Instead of examining south in euclid street,
        try examining the real house.

    Instead of entering the real house,
        try going south.

    Instead of going inside in euclid street,
        try going south.

    Instead of going nowhere in euclid street, say
        "You rack your brain, trying to recall the difference between east and west.
         [paragraph break]Maybe now isn't the time. The thing behind you is getting closer."
