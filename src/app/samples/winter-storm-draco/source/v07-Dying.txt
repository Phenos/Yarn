Section 3 - Dying

Approach is a number that varies. Approach is 0.

Every turn while player is in euclid street:
	increment approach;
	if approach is 3:
		say "The flapping is getting louder; the shrieking is growing more excited.";
	if approach is 4:
		say "The crows aren't here yet, but the cacophany of their approach is deafening.";
	if approach is 5:
		say "The crows have caught up with you.[paragraph break]They're on you all at once, like an avalanche, with beaks and talons tearing apart your jacket, tearing the flesh from your bones, sucking out and swallowing every soft part of your body. Your eyes are gobbled up early on, and so you sense rather than observe the process for most of its duration: Chest, thighs, stomach, neck.[paragraph break]What isn't eaten is licked dry, then carried off into the clouds; not even blood remains to mark the snow. When Winter Storm Draco has finished, there is nothing left to bury.";
		end the story saying "The end."
