Approach is a number that varies. Approach is 0.

Every turn while player is in euclid street:
	increment approach;
	if approach is 3:
		say "The flapping is getting louder; the shrieking is growing more excited.";
	if approach is 4:
		say "The crows aren't here yet, but the cacophany of their approach is deafening.";
	if approach is 5:
		say "The crows have caught up with you.

		    They're on you all at once, like an avalanche, with beaks and talons tearing apart
		    your jacket, tearing the flesh from your bones, sucking out and swallowing every
		    soft part of your body. Your eyes are gobbled up early on, and so you sense rather
		    than observe the process for most of its duration: Chest, thighs, stomach, neck.

		    What isn't eaten is licked dry, then carried off into the clouds; not even blood
		    remains to mark the snow. When Winter Storm Draco has finished, there is nothing
		    left to bury.";

		end the story saying "The end."
