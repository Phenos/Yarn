    <h1>About this prototype</h1>

    <h2>It is still incomplete!</h2>

    <p>
        Yarn Studio is still under developement on a daily basis. What you are using is
        a "work in progress". Major features are still coming.
    </p>

    <h3>Keep in mind that:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It might be missing features you would expect it to have.</li>
        <li>You might encounter bugs.</li>
        <li>The documentation is also growing weekly, but incomplete</li>
        <li>The code you write today might need to change as we improve the platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>But, it's already good for showing: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The overall concept of the application</li>
        <li>The kind of user interfaces and user experience to expect</li>
        <li>The relationship between the player, the editor and the console</li>
        <li>The gameplay experience</li>
        <li>The performance (speed is similar to expected end product)</li>
        <li>How the language look and works in general</li>
        <li>How the game world behaves in relation with the code you write</li>
    </ul>
