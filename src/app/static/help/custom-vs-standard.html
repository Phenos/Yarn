    <h1>Custom vs Standard</h1>

    <p>
        As you start to read the source code for stories and go trough the samples in the help
        articles, the first important notion to learn beside the syntax is that...
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>You have total freedom on the vocabulary you use.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Anything goes...</h2>
    <p>
        As long you you respect the basic <em>YarnScript</em> syntax you will learn
        in the next few articles, you can compose you sentences pretty much any way
        you want. Here is an example of what free form sentences you could write:
    </p>
<code>
Grandma has folded The Laundry.
The Eiffel Tower is taller than The Pyramid Of Giza.
Navin exclaims Offscreen "I am not a bum, I'm a jerk.".
Draxx them Sklounst.
Ted Cruze is certainly not the Zodiak Killer.
Mom has paid the Ransom 2000.
</code>
    <p>
        All the names, verbs and values used above are valid and will be created in
        the "state" of the game when the story is loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
        But all those will be considered as "<strong>Custom</strong>" words as opposed to
        "<strong>Standard</strong>" words.
    </p>
    <h2>With some conventions...</h2>
    <p>
        While you can use a very diverse vocabulary, there are built-in <strong>standard</strong>
        words which you can use to trigger specific game mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a few example of standard words:
    </p>
<code>
Bedroom is a Place.
Player is in the Bedroom.
Bedroom links to Kitchen.
Narrator says Monologue
    "While entering the room you tripped on the dog."
Kitchen has an Image "http://imgur.com/yeh82h.jpg".
</code>
    <p>
        The object names such as "Player", "Place", "Image" and the verbs such as
        "links to", "is a", "is in the" are all recognised by the Yarn platform.
        These words will trigger very specific behaviors when used
        correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        All those conventions and behaviors are documented in further help articles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beside reading the help articles, you can figure out which words are Custom or Standard
        by using the "Inspector" tool in the editor. This tool will also highlight interesting
        facts about the words your selected and bring up
        any relevant help articles about them.
    </p>
    <h2>In summary</h2>
    <p>
        So, let's summarize this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard words : Words that trigger special behaviors and game mechanics.</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Custom words : Any other words you want to use.</strong> </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Custom but Useful</h2>
    <p>
        While you "must" use the standard words for many game mechanics, resorting to custom
        words can be just as usefull. The more complexe you story mechanics will become, the
        more you will profit from a rich custom vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use custom words to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Store more complexe game state.</li>
        <li>Use very specific sentences as condition for triggering events.</li>
        <li>Create your own custom game mechanics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Here is a simple example where we used the custome "owes" verb to keep
        track of how much money a character owes to the player, then add an event
        when the character pays his dept:
    </p>
<code>
John owes money to Player 200.

John Pays His Debt (
    Player has Money "{{ value('Player has Money') + value('John owes money to Player') }}".
    John owes Money 0.
    Narrator says Monologue "John has paid his debt!".
)

// Once you go trough a specific dialog with John,
// he will pay his debt
John Got The Money Dialog triggers John Pays His Debt.
</code>
    <p>
        So, a combination of custom and standard vocabulray is often the best way to get things done.
