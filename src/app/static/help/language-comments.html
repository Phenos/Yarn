    <h1>Comments</h1>

    <p>
        Sometimes it is usefull to add comments to your source code in order
        to better explain what your code is supposed to do or keep track of
        all the ideas you have while writing.
    </p>

    <h2>Line comments</h2>
    <p>You can add single-line comment by using the double slash "//" prefix.</p>
    <code>
// Note: Peter's details are described later in the "characters" file
PeterTheDog is a Dog, called "Peter T. Dog"

// Not sure about this name
JustSusan is called "Silly Susan"
    </code>

    <h2>Block comments</h2>
    <p>
        For longer section of comments you can use the /* */ delimiters to create
        comments blocks (multiple lines)
    </p>
    <code>
John loves PeterTheDog
/*
I have to remember to add a more detailed
description of peter. Also dont forget to add the
backstory for John.
*/
PeterTheDog is a Dog, called "Peter T. Dog"
    </code>
    <h3>Use them anywhere</h3>
    <p>
        Comments can be added elsewhere than at the beginning of lines. Like this:
    </p>
    <code>
John loves PeterTheDog // Maybe too much

PeterTheDog is a Dog /* Obviously */, called "Peter T. Dog"
    </code>

    <h2>
        Commenting out assertions
    </h2>
    <p>
        Remember that comments are also useful for disabling assertions whenever you
        testing your story or to keep track of multiple ideas
    </p>
<code>
PeterTheDog is a Dog, called "Peter T. Dog"
//John loves PeterTheDog
John loves Susan
</code>
