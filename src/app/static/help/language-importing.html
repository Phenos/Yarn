    <h1>Importing</h1>

    <p>
        Most interactive stories will quickly grow into files with thousands of lines of
        code. The more thay grow the more unmanageable and confusing the become.
    </p>
    <p>
        So it is a good idea to separate your stories into multiple files. And then
        import them from your main story file.
    </p>

    <h2>The "import" keyword</h2>

    <p>
        Here is an example with 3 files. A main file using the "<strong>import</strong>"
        keyword to import the other two.
    </p>
    <h4>story.txt</h4>
<code>
  Story has Name "John's crummy bedroom".

  import "characters.txt".
  import "bedroom.txt".
</code>
    <h4>characters.txt</h4>
<code>
  John is an Actor,
  named "John Johnson",
  is in the Bedroom.
</code>
    <h4>bedroom.txt</h4>
<code>
  Bedroom is a Place,
  called "The Bedroom".
</code>
