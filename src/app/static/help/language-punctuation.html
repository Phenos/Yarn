    <h1>Punctuation</h1>

    <h2>Commas, periods and semi-colons.</h2>

    <p>
        By adding puncutation, you can create series of assertions that are both
        easier to write and easier to read.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a comparison of how you can simplify longer text by creating more compact
        sentences using commas.
    </p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog is a Dog.
Peter The Dog is in the Kennel.
Peter The Dog is Tired.
    </code>
    <p>
        Can be shortened to:
    </p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog is a Dog, is in the Kennel, is Tired.
    </code>
    <p>
        Just like a normal english sentence, the commas allow you to chain more assertions
        without having to repeat the subject.</p>

    <h2>Adding linefeeds</h2>
    <p>
        To keep your text more readable, you can cut you line of text inbetween the 3 parts
        of the assertions without any side-effects
    </p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog
is a Dog,
is in the Kennel,
is Tired
    </code>

    <h2>Indentation</h2>

    <p>
        You can also use indentation (additionnal spaces and tabs) if you want to
        give more structure to your code. This is purely aesthetics and will not change
        the behavior of the code.
    </p>
    <p>Let's add some to PeterTheDog:</p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog
  is a Dog,
  is in the Kennel,
  is Tired
    </code>

    <h2>Using quotes for texts and labels</h2>
    <p>For labels and long texts you simply use either the single or double quotes. Like this:</p>
    <code>
Peter The Dog
  is a Dog,
  has a Name "Peter T. Dog",
  is in the Kennel,
  has a Description
    'Peter your dog has had a long day.
     He looks very tired'
    </code>
    <p>
        Notice how you can also add line breaks to break long texts.
    </p>
    <h2>Add periods to prevent chaining.</h2>
    <p>
        Whenever you have assertions which precede or follow each others, you can
        make sure they dont automatically chain by adding a period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we make sure John and PeterTheDog dont get mixed up:
    </p>
    <code>
John loves Peter The Dog.
Peter The Dog
  is a Dog,
  has a Name "Peter T. Dog".
    </code>
    <p>
        Alternativelly, you can use two line breaks instead of periods. Like so:
    </p>
    <code>
John loves Peter The Dog

Peter The Dog is a Dog, called "Peter T. Dog"

Silly Susan loves John
    </code>
