    <h1>Punctuation</h1>

    <h2>Commas, periods and semi-colons.</h2>

    <p>
        By adding puncutation, you can create series of assertions that are both
        easier to write and easier to read.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example of multiple assertions about the same subject, which are
        chained into a longer sentence:
    </p>
    <code>
PeterTheDog is a Dog, is in the Kennel, is Tired
    </code>
    <p>
        Just like a normal english sentence, the commas allow you to chain more assertions
        without having to repeat the subject.</p>

    <h2>Adding linefeeds</h2>
    <p>
        To keep you text more readable, you can cut you line of text inbetween the 3 parts
        of the assertions without any side-effects
    </p>
    <code>
PeterTheDog
is a Dog,
is in the Kennel,
is Tired
    </code>

    <h2>Indentation</h2>

    <p>
        You can also use indentation (additionnal spaces and tabs) if you want to
        give more structure to your code. This is purely aesthetics and will not change
        the behavior of the code.
    </p>
    <p>Let's add some to PeterTheDog:</p>
    <code>
PeterTheDog
  is a Dog,
  is in the Kennel,
  is Tired
    </code>

    <h2>Using quotes for texts and labels</h2>
    <p>For labels and long texts you simply use either the single or double quotes. Like this:</p>
    <code>
PeterTheDog
  is a Dog,
  is named "Peter T. Dog",
  is in the Kennel,
  is described as
    'Peter your dog has had a long day.
     He looks very tired'
    </code>
    <p>
        Notice how we can also add linefeed to break long texts.
    </p>
    <h2>Add periods to prevent chaining.</h2>
    <p>
        Whenever you have assertions which precede or follow each others, you can
        make sure they dont automatically chain by adding a period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we make sure John and PeterTheDog dont get mixed up:
    </p>
    <code>
John loves PeterTheDog.
PeterTheDog
  is a Dog,
  is named "Peter T. Dog".
    </code>
    <p>
        Alternativelly, you can use two linefeeds instead of periods. Like so:
    </p>
    <code>
John loves PeterTheDog

PeterTheDog is a Dog, called "Peter T. Dog"

SillySusan loves John
    </code>
