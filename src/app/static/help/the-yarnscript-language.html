    <h1>The YarnScript Language</h1>

    <p>
        Yarn interactive stories are written using the <em>YarnScript</em> language.
    </p>

    <p>
        These plain text files can be created with any text editor, but are easier to create
        using the <em>Yarn Studio Editor</em>, which provide a rich writting environment.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a small sample how how this langage looks:</p>
    <code lang="javascript">
Cellar Room
  is a Place,
  links to Boiler Room,
  has Name "The Cellar",
  has a Description
    "This cellar is dark, dusty and dry.
    A flight of stair go up."

Bookcase
  is a Thing,
  has a Name "Old Bookcase",
  has a Description "An old bookcase with old books.",
  is in Cellar Room.
</code>

    <p>
        In this example, the author has created a Cellar room with proper names and
        descriptions, and added an old bookcase inside it.
    </p>

    <h2>A "descriptive" language</h2>

    <p>
        YarnScript is what is what is known as a DSL (Domain Specific Language) and has a "Declarative" syntax.
        This means two important things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It has been tailor made for writing interactive stories. It is it's sole purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            The language is used to "describe" your story, instead of programming
            complex and detailed instructions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the example above, the description provided is all you need to let the user enter the Cellar,
        look at the bookcase to see it's description, and then move on to the Boiler Room.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>The actual gameplay mechanics to let the player move about and looking around are already built-in.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        A lot of the hard work of game design is taken care of by the Yarn plateform or supplied by
        existing standard reusable libraries.
    </p>

    <h2>The "Statement" Structure</h2>

    <p>
        While the "Cellar" example shown above look like natural language, it is not. This story fragment follows
        a very specific and very simple syntax.
    </p>

    <p>
        Almost everything in a yarn story is created using series of <strong>Statements</strong>. An statement
        is a truth claim about something in your story using a <strong>Subject</strong>,a
        <strong>Verb</strong>, an <strong>Object</strong> and an optionnal <strong>Value</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a series of simple statements:
    </p>
<code>
Mister Sniffle is a Cat.
Kernel Mustard is in the Study.
Bottle Of Gin is an Inventory Item.
</code>

    <p>
        Lets dissect the <em>Mister Sniffle</em> statement into it's parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject</strong>: Mister Sniffle</li>
        <li><strong>Verb</strong>: is a</li>
        <li><strong>Object</strong>: Cat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once in the game, this statement will create an object called "MisterSniffles" and another object called "Cat".
    </p>

    <p>
        Then it will create a "is a" relationship between the two objects.
    </p>

    <h3>Mind the uppercase and lowercase</h3>

    <p>
        The way that YarnScrip differentiate between each part of the statements is simply by checking
        which words start with either lowercase or uppercase letters. The rules are very simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Objects</strong>
            start with an uppercase letter.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Verbs</strong> are in lowercase.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can use multiple word for both Verbs and Objects
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now let's look at a few more examples and notice how these rules apply:</p>
    <code>
Story has Author "John Doe".
You are in Johns Bedroom.
Entering The Castle triggers Gates Close.
    </code>
