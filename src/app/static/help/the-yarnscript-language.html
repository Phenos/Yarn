    <h1>The YarnScript Language</h1>

    <p>
        Yarn interactive stories are written using the <em>YarnScript</em> language.
    </p>
    <p>
        These plain text files can be created with any text editor, but are easier to create
        using the <em>Yarn Studio Editor</em>, which provide a rich writting environment.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a small sample how how this langage looks:</p>
    <code lang="javascript">
TheCellar
  is a Place,
  links to BoilerRoom,
  has Name "The Cellar",
  has Description
    "This cellar is dark, dusty and dry.
    A flight of stair go up."

BookCase
  is a Thing,
  has a Name "Old Bookcase",
  has Description "An old bookcase with old books.",
  is in TheCellar.
</code>

    <p>
        In this example, the author has created a Cellar room with proper names and
        descriptions, and added an old bookcase inside it.
    </p>

    <h2>A "descriptive" language</h2>

    <p>
        YarnScript is what is what is known as a DSL (Domain Specific Language) and has a "Declarative" syntax.
        This means two important things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It has been tailor made for writing interactive stories. It is it's sole purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            The language is used to "describe" your story, instead of programming
            complex and detailed instructions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the example above, the description provided is all you need to let the user enter the Cellar,
        look at the bookcase to see it's description, and then move on to the Boiler Room.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>The actual gameplay mechanics to let the player move about and looking around are already built-in.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of the hard work of game design is taken care of by the Yarn plateforme or supplied by
        existing standard reusable libraries.
    </p>
    <h2>The "Assertions" Structure</h2>
    <p>
        While the "Cellar" example shown above look like natural language, it is not. This story fragment follows
        a very specific and very simple syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything in a yarn story is build using series of <strong>Assertions</strong>. An assertion
        is a truth statement about something in your story using a <strong>Subject</strong>,a
        <strong>Verb</strong> and usually an <strong>Object</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        To make things simpler, you can think of assertions as statements of facts.
        Here is a series of simple assertions:
    </p>
    <code>
MisterSniffle is a Cat.
KernelMustard is in the Study.
BottleOfGin is an InventoryItem.
    </code>
    <p>
        Lets explode the <em>MisterSniffle</em> assertion into it's parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject</strong>: MisterSniffle</li>
        <li><strong>Verb</strong>: is a</li>
        <li><strong>Object</strong>: Cat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once in the game, this assertion will create an object called "MisterSniffles" and another object called "Cat".
    </p>
    <p>
        Then it will create a "is a" relationship between the two objects.
    </p>
    <h3>Mind the uppercase and lowercase</h3>
    <p>
        The way that YarnScrip differentiate between each part of the phrase is simply by checking
        which words start with either lowercase or uppercase letters. The rules are very simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Things like Subjects and Objects start with an uppercase and have no spaces.</li>
        <li>Pedicates are in lowercase and can have spaces in them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now let's look at a few more examples and notice how these rules apply:</p>
    <code>
Story has Author "John Doe".
You are in YourBedroom.
YouEnterTheCastle triggers GatesClose.
    </code>
    <p>
        The way that uppercase letters are also used in the middle of object names is called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">CamelCase</a> and helps in making the
        more complex names more readable.
