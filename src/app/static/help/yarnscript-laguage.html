    <h1>The YarnScript Language</h1>

    <p>
        Yarn interactive stories are built using the <em>YarnScript</em> language.
        Authors can create and edit these YarnScript files from the <em>Yarn Studio Editor</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a small sample how how the langage looks:</p>
    <code lang="javascript">
TheCellar:
  is a Room,
  links to BoilerRoom,
  is called "The Cellar,
  is described as
    "This cellar is dark, dusty and dry.
    A flight of stair go up."

BookCase:
  is a Thing,
  is called "Old Bookcase",
  is described as "An old bookcase with old books.",
  is in TheCellar.
</code>

    <p>
        In this example, the author has created a Cellar room with proper names and
        descriptions, and added an old bookcase inside it.
    </p>

    <h2>A "descriptive" language</h2>

    <p>
        YarnScript is what is called a "Domain Specific Declarative Language".
        This means two important things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It has been tailor made for writing interactive stories. It is it's sole purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            You "describe" your story, instead of programming
            every instructions and interactions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the example above, the description provided is all you need to let the user enter the Cellar,
        look at the bookcase to see it's description, and then move on to the Boiler Room.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>The actual gameplay mechanics to let the player move about and looking around are already built-in.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>The "Assertions" Structure</h2>
    <p>
        While the "Cellar" example look like natural language, it is not. This story fragment follows
        a very specific and very simple syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything in a yarn story is build using series of <strong>Assertions</strong>. An assertion
        is a truth statement about something in your story using a <strong>Subject</strong>,a
        <strong>Predicate</strong> and usually an <strong>Object</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        To make things simpler, you can think of assertions as specialized sentences.
        Here is a series of simple assertions:
    </p>
    <code>
MisterSniffle is a Cat.
KernelMustard is in the Study.
BottleOfGin is an InventoryItem.
    </code>
    <p>
        Lets explode the <em>MisterSniffle</em> assertion into it's parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject</strong>: MisterSniffled</li>
        <li><strong>Predicate</strong>: is a</li>
        <li><strong>Object</strong>: Cat</li>
    </ul>
