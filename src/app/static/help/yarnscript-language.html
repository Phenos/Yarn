    <h1>The YarnScript Language</h1>

    <p>
        Yarn interactive stories are built using the <em>YarnScript</em> language.
        Authors can create and edit these YarnScript files from the <em>Yarn Studio Editor</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a small sample how how the langage looks:</p>
    <code lang="javascript">
TheCellar
  is a Room,
  links to BoilerRoom,
  is called "The Cellar",
  is described as
    "This cellar is dark, dusty and dry.
    A flight of stair go up."

BookCase
  is a Thing,
  is called "Old Bookcase",
  is described as "An old bookcase with old books.",
  is in TheCellar.
</code>

    <p>
        In this example, the author has created a Cellar room with proper names and
        descriptions, and added an old bookcase inside it.
    </p>

    <h2>A "descriptive" language</h2>

    <p>
        YarnScript is what is called a "Domain Specific Declarative Language".
        This means two important things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It has been tailor made for writing interactive stories. It is it's sole purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            You "describe" your story, instead of programming
            every instructions and interactions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the example above, the description provided is all you need to let the user enter the Cellar,
        look at the bookcase to see it's description, and then move on to the Boiler Room.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>The actual gameplay mechanics to let the player move about and looking around are already built-in.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>The "Assertions" Structure</h2>
    <p>
        While the "Cellar" example look like natural language, it is not. This story fragment follows
        a very specific and very simple syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything in a yarn story is build using series of <strong>Assertions</strong>. An assertion
        is a truth statement about something in your story using a <strong>Subject</strong>,a
        <strong>Predicate</strong> and usually an <strong>Object</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        To make things simpler, you can think of assertions as specialized sentences.
        Here is a series of simple assertions:
    </p>
    <code>
MisterSniffle is a Cat.
KernelMustard is in the Study.
BottleOfGin is an InventoryItem.
    </code>
    <p>
        Lets explode the <em>MisterSniffle</em> assertion into it's parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject</strong>: MisterSniffled</li>
        <li><strong>Predicate</strong>: is a</li>
        <li><strong>Object</strong>: Cat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once in the game, this assertion will create an object called "MisterSniffles" and another object called "Cat".
    </p>
    <p>
        Then it will create a "is a" relationship between the two objects.
    </p>
    <h3>Mind the uppercase and lowercase</h3>
    <p>
        The way that YarnScrip differentiate between each part of the phrase is simply by checking
        which words start with either lowercase or uppercase letters. The rules are very simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subject and Object references start with an uppercase and have no spaces.</li>
        <li>Pedicates are in lowercase and can have spaces in them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now let's look at a few more examples and notice how these rules apply:</p>
    <code>
YouEnterTheCastle triggers GatesClose.
Story is authored by JohnDoe.
You are in YourBedroom.
    </code>
    <p>
        The way that uppercase letters are also used in the middle of object names is called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">CamelCase</a> and helps in making the
        more complex names more readable.
