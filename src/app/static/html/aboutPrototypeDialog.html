                    Yarn Studio is still under developement on a daily basis and what you are using is
                    a only a prototype for demonstration purposes.
                </p>
                <h3>Keep in mind that:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is not a complete and finished product. You might encounter bugs.</li>
                    <li>The documentation is also incomplete</li>
                    <li>The code you write in the editor might be deleted/lost in future versions of the servive.</li>
                    <li>While writing the story, you will not get a lot of hint on compilation errors</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>But, it's a good demonstration of: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overall concept of the application (web app, mobile)</li>
                    <li>The kind of user interfaces and user experience to expect</li>
                    <li>The relationship between the player, the editor and the console</li>
                    <li>The gameplay experience on the player/reader</li>
                    <li>The performance (speed is similar to expected end product)</li>
                    <li>How the language look and works in general</li>
                    <li>How the world behaves  in relation with the code you write and the gameplay</li>
                </ul>
