You have health 30.  // Assign using assertinos
You have health +5.  // Increment or decrement using assertion
You have health *0.5.  // Divide or multiply or decrement using assertion

You have attribute Health [5]. // Is this necessary if we already have "gain" ?
You gain Health [5].
You loose Health [3]. // Can both be replace with negative and positive numbers ?
You gain Health [-5].

// The player burns himself when touhing the fire

TouchingTheFire () triggers YouTouchTheFire.

/*
SCENARIO:

The player can get burn only once, having touched the fire once is noted for
later use in the story. Touching the fire drops your health by 3 points

This scenario demonstrates:

- The use of assertion ordering with the [1] notation
- Triggering different state changes on repeated actions
- Affecting
