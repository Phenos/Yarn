# THE "TOUCHING FIRE TWICE" SCENARIO:

A magical blue flame is on the floor. If the player touches it he burns his hand.
The player can get burn only once, after which he is "marked" for
later use in the story. Also, touching the blue fire drops your health by 3 points

Touching the flame a second time will extinguish it, and the black pebble that was under
the flame can be taken into inventory.

## This scenario demonstrates:

- Triggers and state changes
- Different triggers on repeated actions
- Negation assertions with the "!" operator
- The use of assertion ordering with the [1] notation
- Modifying attributes

//--- STEP 1 : Events when touching the flame ---//

// Trigger when you touch the blue fire for the first time
// Note: The "touch" assertion is a momentary state when the user touches anything.
// Also, here we test for a custom negative assertion using the "!" operator
Touch_The_Fire is a Condition (

) triggers Burning_Yourself.

// When you touch the fire we make a few changes to the state before outputing the narration
// Note: The "Immediatly" object is used to trigger another state change immediatly after it is applied

Burning_Yourself is a Change (
    1. Immediatly trigger Burning_Yourself_Dialog.
    2. You are marked by The_Fire
        and is affected by Blue_Flame_Hit.
)

// When changing the "Health" assertion, we use a formula
// to add 3 to the current health
Blue_Flame_Hit is a Formula (
    affects Health
    decrease by 3
)

        hand and you feel a hot sting. Your quickly take your hand away with the faint

        You feel like you havesomehow been marked."


//--- STEP 2 : Events when touching the flame a second time ---//


// Once the player is marked with the custome predicte,

    // We switch the The blue flame for the black pebble
    TheBlueFlame is not in The_Dark_Room.
    The_Black_Pebble in in The_Dark_Room.
    Immediatly trigger Blue_Flame_Disapears.  // ???? SHOULD Dialogs also use the "trigger" predicate ????
) triggered when Touching_The_Fire_When_Marked. // The "triggered by" and "triggered when" are synonyms

Blue_Flame_Disapears is a Dialog by The_Narrator
    has Text "As you near you hand to the fire you see the
        flame twitch... suddenly disapears,
        recoiling back into the black pebble.
        Brushing your finger on the pebble reveals
        it is very cold to the touch."
